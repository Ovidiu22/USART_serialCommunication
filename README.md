# USART_serialCommunication
 
A C-libary for USART communication between your PC and an Arduino Uno/Nano.
Remarks:
- Based on the blogpost https://efundies.com/avr-and-printf/
- The difference is that it can be directly integrated into bigger projects just by copying the two source files (USART.h and USART.c) and including them in main
- Offers the possibility to display into the serial monitor strings and values using the function printf
- Plain C Compatible
- Windows Supported
